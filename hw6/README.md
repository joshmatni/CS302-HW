# Homework 6

## Assignment Goals
The goal of this project is to:
1.  Continue practice with **linked storage**
2.	Familiarize students with **trees**
3.	Continue practice with **recursion**

## Problem
Let's practice working with trees!
### Overview
Randomly generate 100 *unique* values in the range of 1 to 200 and insert them into a binary search tree (BST). Print height and inorder, preorder, and postoder output of the BST tree.  

## Requirements

### Deliverables
The Tree Interface and Node Class have already been provided for you in this repository. Your submission should include
-  source code
    -  a *modular* main driver
    -  the ***complete*** linked implementation for a Binary Tree Class
    -  the ***complete*** linked implementation for a Binary Search Tree Class
-  a makefile
-  an output text file with
    -  the final height of the tree
    -  results from the inorder traversal
    -  results from the preorder traversal
    -  results from the postorder traversal

## Submission details
If you are usinng git from the command line, execute the following commands:
1.	After accepting the assignment invitation, copy the clone URL
2.	Type 
```git clone clone URL```
3.	cd into your new assignment directory
4.	After working on your files
5.	When you’re ready, type the following commands: 
```
git add .
git commit -m “your commit message”
git push
```
## Academic Honesty
Academic dishonesty is against university as well as the system community standards. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Plagiarism: defined as submitting the language, ideas, thoughts or work of another as one's own; or assisting in the act of plagiarism by allowing one's work to be used in this fashion.
Cheating: defined as (1) obtaining or providing unauthorized information during an examination through verbal, visual or unauthorized use of books, notes, text and other materials; (2) obtaining or providing information concerning all or part of an examination prior to that examination; (3) taking an examination for another student, or arranging for another person to take an exam in one's place; (4) altering or changing test answers after submittal for grading, grades after grades have been awarded, or other academic records once these are official.
Cheating, plagiarism or otherwise obtaining grades under false pretenses constitute academic
dishonesty according to the code of this university. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated and
penalties can include cancelling a student’s enrolment without a grade, giving an F for the course, or for the assignment. For more details, see the University of Nevada, Reno General Catalog.
